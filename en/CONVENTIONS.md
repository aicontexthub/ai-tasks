# 📐 Conventions – AI Tasks CLI

This file defines the internal conventions for naming, structuring, and organizing tasks (`tasks`) and their associated files within the `ai-tasks` repository.

---

## 🗂️ General Structure

```
tasks/
├── templates/          # Reusable templates (.yaml, .txt, .md)
├── examples/           # Tasks executed in real projects
├── reviews/            # Detailed reviews of completed tasks
├── CONVENTIONS.md      # This file
├── task.config.json    # Global configuration
└── README.md           # Main repository instructions
```

## 📄 File Naming Conventions

| File Type             | Recommended Format                   | Example                    |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Task (`task`)         | `task-<id>.yaml`                     | `task-001.yaml`            |
| Review (`review`)     | `review-task-<id>.md`                | `review-task-001.md`       |
| Template (`template`) | `<name>.yaml` / `.txt` / `.md`       | `create-project.txt`       |
| Task Alias            | `task new:` / `task create-project:` | CLI-friendly, no extension |

---

## 📦 Template Extensions

| Extension | Recommended Use                                       |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `.yaml`   | 100% YAML-compatible templates                        |
| `.txt`    | Dynamic templates with conditionals (`{{#if}}`, etc.) |
| `.md`     | Documentation or review templates (Markdown)          |

## 🌐 Language Policy

This repository is primarily written in Spanish, but optimized for AI agents that operate better in English.

### 🧠 Language Variables in Tasks

Each `task.yaml` can include:

```yaml
language: es # Human input language
output_language: es # Expected agent output language
```

This allows the AI to:

- Translate internally to English to better understand the task
- Generate the final output in Spanish or English, according to the `output_language` value

### ⚙️ Code Always in English

- Generated code, filenames, structures, and technical conventions must **always be in English** to maintain compatibility and best practices.

---

## ⚙️ Global Configuration – task.config.json

You can define default configurations for the entire task system in the `task.config.json` file, located in the repository root.

Example:

```json
{
  "default_language": "es",
  "default_output_language": "es",
  "force_output_code_language": "en",
  "task_id_format": "task-###.yaml",
  "review_id_format": "review-task-###.md",
  "templates_path": "./templates",
  "examples_path": "./examples",
  "reviews_path": "./reviews",
  "project_context": "AI Context Hub"
}
```

This allows AI agents, collaborators, or CLI tools to respect a common and consistent configuration.

---

## 💾 Recommendation: Commits When Finishing Tasks

When completing any task or microtask generated by AI or a collaborator, it's recommended to include at the end of the message:

```
Don't forget to commit!
```

And suggest a useful command as a reference:

```bash
git add tasks/examples/ai-context-hub/task-003-implement-dashboard-protection.yaml
git commit -m "feat: implement dashboard route protection"
```

### ✅ Suggested Commit Prefix Convention

| Prefix      | Use                                    |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `feat:`     | New functionality                      |
| `fix:`      | Bug fixes                              |
| `docs:`     | Documentation changes                  |
| `chore:`    | Maintenance/config tasks               |
| `refactor:` | Internal refactor without logic change |
| `test:`     | Test changes or additions              |

> Although not mandatory, following this convention improves traceability and readability of the change history.

---

## 🧠 Additional Recommendations

- `id`s should be numeric and sequential (`001`, `002`, `003`) for natural ordering.
- `review`s should always go in `reviews/`.
- `examples` are grouped by project within `examples/`.
- Every significant technical task should have its review (`review-task-xxx.md`).
- `.md` and `.yaml` files should be clear, without hidden logic, and 100% copyable.

## 📌 Final Notes

This system is optimized for the workflow of [AI Context Hub](https://www.aicontexthub.com), but can be easily adapted to any AI-assisted development environment.
