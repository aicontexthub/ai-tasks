| ------------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Objective achievement     | ✅ Achieved   | The `gradient` variant was correctly implemented.              |
| Component reuse           | ❌ Incomplete | Duplicated classes instead of using the `Button` component.    |
| Design consistency        | ⚠️ Partial    | Correct colors were used, but standard typography was missing. |
| Code cleanliness          | ✅ Correct    | Well-organized and typed code.                                 |
| Use of defined patterns   | ❌ Missing    | Did not apply centralized variants (`buttonVariants`).         |
| Context applied correctly | ⚠️ Partial    | The agent knew what to do, but didn't apply it optimally.      |

## 🐞 Detected Errors

- Button with duplicated Tailwind classes instead of reusing `variant="gradient"`.
- Did not respect the existing `button.tsx` in `ui/`.

---

## 🧠 Lessons / Improvements

- Ensure the agent has loaded the context of reusable components before generating UI.
- Document `button.md` within `contexts/ui-components` for reference.

## ✅ Verdict

**Functional task but with room for improvement.**  
The objective is met, but the design system conventions are not fully respected. Requires manual review or a version 2 of the task.
