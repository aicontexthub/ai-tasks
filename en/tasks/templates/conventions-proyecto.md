# 📐 Project Development Conventions

This document defines the internal development conventions to maintain consistency, readability, and technical quality within the project.

## 📁 Recommended Folder Structure

```
src/
├── components/           # Reusable components
├── features/            # Functional modules by domain (auth, dashboard, etc.)
├── lib/                 # Shared functions and utilities
├── pages/               # Routes (Next.js or similar frameworks)
├── styles/              # CSS/Tailwind files
├── hooks/               # Custom hooks
└── types/               # Global types (TypeScript)
```

## 📄 File and Component Names

| Element    | Convention              | Example             |
| ---------- | ----------------------- | ------------------- |
| Components | PascalCase              | `UserCard.tsx`      |
| Hooks      | camelCase, prefix `use` | `useAuth.ts`        |
| Files      | kebab-case              | `user-card.tsx`     |
| Test files | same name + `.test.ts`  | `user-card.test.ts` |

---

## 🌐 Language

- All **file names, variables, functions, and comments** must be in **English**.
- User-facing content can be in multiple languages (`i18n`).
- Internal team documentation can be in Spanish if specified.

---

## 🧪 Testing

- Preference for `unit tests` using **Jest** or **Vitest**
- Each hook, utility, or component must have its test when applicable
- Tests must reside alongside the source file or in `/__tests__/`

---

## 🧹 Style and Lint

- Use `eslint` with rules adapted for TypeScript + React
- Use `prettier` for automatic formatting
- `lint-staged` + `husky` in pre-commits (optional but recommended)

---

## 💾 Recommendation: Commits when finishing tasks

When finishing any task or microtask generated by AI or collaborator, it is recommended to include at the end of the message:

```
Don't forget to commit!
```

And suggest a useful command as reference:

```bash
git add tasks/examples/ai-context-hub/task-003-implement-dashboard-protection.yaml
git commit -m "feat: implement dashboard route protection"
```

### ✅ Suggested convention for commit prefixes

| Prefix      | Use                                    |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `feat:`     | New functionality                      |
| `fix:`      | Bug fixes                              |
| `docs:`     | Documentation changes                  |
| `chore:`    | Maintenance/config tasks               |
| `refactor:` | Internal refactor without logic change |
| `test:`     | Test changes or additions              |

> Although not mandatory, following this convention improves traceability and readability of the change history.

## 🔁 Pull Requests

- Clear, brief title in present tense
- Description with **what, why, and how**
- Link the task if applicable (Jira, Linear, GitHub Issues...)
- Include tests or screenshots if it's UI

---

## 🧠 Code Review

- Clear code > ready code
- Descriptive names > abbreviations
- Avoid repeating logic → create utilities/tools
- If a change breaks an existing pattern, it must be justified

---

## 📝 Documentation

- Document important decisions in a `docs/` file or in `README.md`
- Always document when adding something that impacts other developers
