# üß† AI Tasks

> A lightweight, multilingual system for creating, organizing, and reviewing AI-assisted development tasks ‚Äî built for developers who want clarity, consistency, and control when working with AI.

---

## ‚ùì Why this project exists

Working with AI (ChatGPT, Cursor, Claude, Copilot...) can be powerful ‚Äî but also frustrating.  
You often face the same issues:

- Repeating your project context in every prompt
- Getting inconsistent or duplicated code
- Receiving vague, incomplete, or unstructured results
- Struggling to define clear instructions for agents

**AI Tasks** solves this by introducing a reusable, versioned system of structured tasks and context.  
It's like version control, but for your prompts, logic, and standards ‚Äî built for reuse, precision, and collaboration.

## üß© What is this repository?

This is the canonical repository for the **AI Tasks format** used in [AI Context Hub](https://www.aicontexthub.com). It provides:

- üìÅ Examples of well-defined tasks in YAML format
- üß© Templates to create tasks, project context, and reviews
- üåê Multilingual folders (`es/`, `en/`, etc.) with localized documentation

This repo is not a CLI (yet), but can be used manually, via agents, or integrated into your own tooling.

---

## üîß How does it work?

1. Copy the `/tasks/` folder into your project.
2. Use `create-project.txt` to generate context interactively.
3. Write new structured tasks using `task-template-avanzado.yaml`.
4. Review executed tasks with `review-template.md`.
5. Add your own structure, steps, criteria, and context for agents.

## üåç Languages

This repository supports multiple languages:

- üá™üá∏ [Espa√±ol](./es/README.md)
- üá¨üáß [English](./en/README.md)

More coming soon: Portuguese, French, Italian...

## üîÆ What's next?

These are ideas we would love to see evolve within this system ‚Äî feel free to contribute:

- üß† AI-powered task review system
- üõ†Ô∏è CLI interface to launch tasks and auto-generate files
- üîÑ Integration with local agents (ChatGPT, Cursor, Claude)
- üß± Templates for stack-specific projects (React, Python, Laravel, etc.)
- üóÇÔ∏è Import/export via `.task.yaml` format across editors or tools

You‚Äôre welcome to open an issue or submit a pull request if you‚Äôd like to help build any of these!

## üß™ Examples by stack

Real project examples are located in the root `/examples` folder, grouped by technology.

| Stack           | Path                        | Description                    |
| --------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| React + Next.js | `/examples/react-frontend/` | Modern frontend SaaS project   |
| Python backend  | `/examples/python-api/`     | FastAPI-based task definitions |
| CLI utilities   | `/examples/dev-cli/`        | Tasks for Node/Python tool dev |

> All examples use **English** for compatibility with AI agents.

Want to add a new one? Fork this repo, create a folder inside `/examples/`, and follow the naming convention: `task-###.yaml`.
